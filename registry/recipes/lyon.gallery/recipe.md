# Triangles inside a curved contour

Lyon tessellates an original curved contour at three tolerances. The displayed edges are the triangles produced by the native Rust tessellator.

Lyon으로 직접 만든 곡선 윤곽을 세 허용 오차에서 삼각분할했어요. 네이티브 Rust 테셀레이터가 만든 삼각형의 변을 보여 줘요.

## Setup

Install Rust and Cargo (tested with Rust 1.90.0) and a native linker. Map the listed assets into in/. Cargo.toml pins direct dependencies and Cargo.lock records resolved versions and checksums. First execution downloads and compiles the selected example's crates; later runs reuse Cargo's cache. Opening the example downloads only its prepared files.

Rust 1.90.0에서 검증했어요. 파일을 in/에 연결하세요. 재실행할 때만 해당 예제의 의존성을 받고 Cargo 캐시를 재사용해요. 예제를 여는 것만으로 Rust나 의존성을 설치하지 않아요.

## Run

```json
["cargo", "run", "--locked", "--release", "--manifest-path", "in/Cargo.toml", "--", "out"]
```

## Verify

Executed the supplied source and locked dependencies on macOS arm64. The driver checks finite geometry and nonempty outputs or rendered pixels. This viewer presents saved results from that execution.

## Notes

Original synthetic input and driver. Edit main.rs and rerun to change inputs; the viewer selects precomputed results. GPU output pixels may vary by adapter.
